### Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Debian GUI
Removing the Debian GUI is straightforward with these commands. Before proceeding, ensure you backup any important data.

Open your terminal and enter the following command to remove the X11 common package, which is a core component of the Debian GUI:
```
apt-get remove -y --purge x11-common
```
Next, clean up any unused packages and dependencies:
```
apt-get autoremove -y --purge
```
To identify any orphaned packages that were not automatically removed, install 'deborphan':
```
apt-get install -y deborphan
```
Finally, use 'deborphan' to list and remove orphaned packages. Repeat this step until no more orphaned packages are listed:
```
deborphan | xargs dpkg -P
```
By following these steps, you'll successfully remove the Debian GUI from your server, potentially increasing its performance and efficiency for your specific needs.
